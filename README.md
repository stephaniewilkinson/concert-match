## Technologies Used
* Javascript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* OAuth (Spotify)
* APIs (Spotify, Bands in Town, Mapbox)
* HTML
* CSS (Materialize)

## APIs
* Spotify API to GET top artists of logged in user
* BandsInTown API to GET concert data for top artists in 50 mile radius of current location
* Mapbox to display current location and concert data on map

## Approach
We wanted to create a simple, streamlined app to find local concerts based on the user's top spotify artists. We stripped away additional features found on apps like [Bands in Town](http://news.bandsintown.com/home), [Songkick](http://www.songkick.com/), or [Ticketmaster](http://www.ticketmaster.com/) such as setting search parameters and buying tickets in order to create a focused, uncomplicated user experience.

Our app is personalized and local for each user. Once the user logs in, our app finds and displays all the information they need by searching for concerts of their top [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) artists in a 50 mile radius of their current location.
